1151. Minimum Swaps to Group All 1's Together

Given a binary array data, return the minimum number of swaps required to group all 1â€™s present in the array together in any place in the array.

Input: data = [1,0,1,0,1]
Output: 1

Input: data = [0,0,0,1,0]
Output: 0

Input: data = [1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 3
